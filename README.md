### 10-703 Project: Manipulation Environment

Taken in the fall of 2018 at Carnegie Mellon University.  In the repo you will find my final report which dealt with the manipulation environment given to us in class.  You will also find *(admittedly homework-grade)* code for various algorithms discussed in lecture. Please contact `josephkim@cmu.edu` for questions.
